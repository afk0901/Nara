A small Next.js project where I’m building core pieces of a larger idea.

Bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Currently implemented:

- Email dialog flow when clicked on "Register".

- Custom email validation logic (fully tested with Vitest)

- Domain-layer separation for validator logic

Tech:

- Next.js

- TypeScript

- Vitest

- Tailwind

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
